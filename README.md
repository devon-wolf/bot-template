# bot-template

## Resources
- [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin)
	- The basic tutorial bot that the Discord.js guide walks you through served as the base for this template, though I will deviate from the format in several places.
	- The detailed Discord.js documentation can be found [here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome); I do not recommend wading into it if you are brand new to JavaScript - I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to use it before I had a grasp of how to really *read* JS, and it caused more confusion and angst than it was worth. Coming back to it after four-ish months of deep study and practice has been eye-opening - if you're well-versed enough in JavaScript that you can reliably differentiate between methods that are built-in and methods coming from something in a library/non built-in class, the documentation should be comfortable.
